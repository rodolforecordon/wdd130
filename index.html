      I know every person is unique, but I am trying hard on this one. I am a left-handed
      Brazilian redhead &#x1F448;&#x1F3FB; &#x1F1E7;&#x1F1F7; &#x1F9D1;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x1F9B0;.

    <p>What?!?!? ... Not convinced? Ok, I got this!</p>
    <p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints &#x1F60E;.</p>
    <p>... Come on! What are the odds?</p>
    <p>
      Well, this is me. It may not look like much, but thank you for getting to my webpage to get
      to know me a little better.
    </p>
    <p>P.S.: Here is what my buddy Gemini has to say about this.</p>
