      I know every person is unique, but I am trying hard on this one. I am a left-handed
      Brazilian redhead &#x1F448;&#x1F3FB; &#x1F1E7;&#x1F1F7; &#x1F9D1;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x1F9B0;.
    </p>
    <p>What?!?!? ... Not convinced? Ok, I got this!</p>
    <p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints &#x1F60E;.</p>
    <p>... Come on! What are the odds?</p>
    <p>
      Well, this is me. It may not look like much, but thank you for getting to my webpage to get
      to know me a little better.
    </p>
    <p>P.S.: Here is what my buddy Gemini has to say about this.</p>

    <h2>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil / Porto, Portugal</h2>

    <p>Portugal and Brazil are like father and son. Their shared heritage is undeniable: they speak the same language,
      though with different accents, and Portuguese architecture is found everywhere in Brazil. This common bond
      extends to the people, who in both countries are hardworking and very devoted to their families. In a twist of
      familial irony, this also includes a shared struggle with excessive bureaucracy.</p>
    <p>True to a father-son dynamic, their relationship is complex, marked by both love and occasional frustration. Yet,
      for all their shared history, their natural worlds stand in stark contrast, with vastly different fauna and flora.
      Despite this, I have never met anyone who would deny that both are absolutely beautiful countries.</p>
